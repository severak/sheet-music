# sheet-music

Sheet music of some well-known songs written in [Alda](https://alda.io/) music programming language so it can be read both by me and computers.

Note: these songs were not written by me I only transcribed them for my own education. I am unable to read proper sheet music and Alda is readable both by me and my computer.

## how to play these?

a) install [Alda](https://alda.io/) on your computer

or

b) use [Alda web workspace](https://severak.github.io/alda-js/) in your browser
